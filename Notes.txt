Notes for my Python-MYSQL-User_Interface:

	- Config file:
		- Python can have congif files with all setting needed by the 
		  application dynamically or periodically.
		- Python config files have the extension as .ini
		- A configuration file is a file that contains data about a program or 
		  specific user settings that is needed to run the application. 
		- Creating .ini config files:
			- The .ini file is a configuration file with an .ini extension.
			- Python provides a buit-in module called congifpaser to read .ini files
			- Create a config.ini file inside the project direction and format it like this:
				- "[Name of section}
				-  dataName = data
				-  dataName2 = data2"
